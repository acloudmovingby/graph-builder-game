For this project I tried to explore different ways of building graphs (in the computer science sense of graphs, which are basically just networks). The goal was to create a WYSIWYG tool that was intuitive and fast at building small graphs. As of July 2021, this links to the prototype version where there are "easter egg" graphs that you can discover with commentary that encourages the user while analyzing their graphs. 

# Briefly, what are graphs?
Graphs in computer science were poorly named as they're easily confused with the graphs we learn about in high school. Graphs in CS, however, are really about networks. 

Graphs are represented as a collection of "nodes" connected together. These nodes can also be called vertices, and the relationship between two nodes is called an edge. A simple example might be a family tree, where each parent node connects to their children nodes. In that example, the people are the nodes and edges represent their familial relationships. 

Technologies ranging from Google maps to protein identification to fingerprint identification are all made possibly by graphs. Graphs are fascinating becasue they can be used to model practically any situation because they essentially are about a collection of entities and the relationships between those entities.
