(Update 2025)

Just playing around with it, these are some things that would be cool to change/incorporate:
- make text a bit bigger on right side
- Have an About section somewhere. Maybe just more tabs in general on the right pane to distinguish various things.
- For the export tab, have a suggestion on how to use a dot format file.
- Actual downloadable dot format not just copy
- Deletion tools! (delete nodes/edges)
- When connected components happen, make big animation to indicate. Maybe bigger animation when large components connect.
- Likewise, maybe have animations/indicators when you form various graph types, e.g. trees, cyclical, etc.
- Directed edges??? That's gonna be tricky and complicated to think about, but is arguably 'important' if you wanted to use this for real use-cases.
- Redo button
- Hotkeys, e.g. ctrl+z for undo, escape to exit a certain tool mode
- After you clear switch back to basic node tool (otherwise the text "try clicking somewhere" doesn't make sense)
